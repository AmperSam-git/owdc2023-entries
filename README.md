This repository has all of the entries submitted to SMW Central's "[Overworld Design Contest 2023](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=124585)".

## Patching

To patch all the entries, open `flips.exe` and when picking a BPS you can select all of the level patches to bulk apply them to your clean copy of Super Mario World. These can then be used in the emulator or on the console of your choosing.
